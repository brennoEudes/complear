## About Complear

Complear is a health tech that partners with Digital Health companies to bring medical device products to market, either with its boutique regulatory and compliance services or by building the future operating system for automating regulatory and compliance using a platform powered by Artificial Intelligence.

## Activities

My responsibilities were to update and to develop new front-end features in the Complear platform, building and stylizing new components, such as login and profile pages, buttons, card information, menu icons, and product forms.

Moreover, I created new product pages, with an authentication system, to verify and display the product information according to the user type. In this context, it was required to create relations between the front-end product page components, the back-end (installing NodeJS), and the Database (installing Mongo DB).

See further details in the 2 min video and images attached.

## Product Team

It was part of my daily routine to interact with the CIO and the International Product team to prioritize the tasks in the sprint (ClickUp). All commits were pushed to the GitLab platform.

## Technologies

The technologies used were:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- ReactJS;
- NodeJS;
- Mongo Data Base;
- GitLab;
- Git and GitHub.
